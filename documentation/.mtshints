# Documentation Style Guide

## Brand Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: The product name "MTS" (Magezi Tech Solutions) should be written consistently in all documentation, blog posts, and content within this documentation directory.

- ✅ Correct: "MTS", "using MTS", "MTS provides"
- ✅ Also acceptable: "mts" when referring to CLI commands or file paths
- ❌ Incorrect: "Mts", "using mTS"

This is a brand guideline that must be strictly followed.

## Context

This rule applies to:
- All markdown files in `/docs/`
- All blog posts in `/blog/`
- README files
- Configuration files with user-facing text
- Any other documentation content

When editing or creating content in this documentation directory, always ensure "MTS" is properly capitalized.
