As the mts team continues to work on new features over 800 community members voted to express their need for MTS on Windows. Today's top contributor stepped in to aid this ongoing effort.

## Windows Support

Since the launch of codename mts, the open source community has been wanting and requesting the same automation by mts on Windows.

Currently, mts's CLI version works on Windows with limited built-in extensions via WSL, or Windows Subsystem for Linux. While there is a limited internal beta in the works, there are several bugs and improvements that are being worked on to ensure codename mts has the same seamless experience as it does on Mac.

## ATrueLight4's MTS4Win

Our featured contributor, [ATrueLight4](https://github.com/ATrueLight4), shipped **MTS4Win**, a fix that improves how MTS handles Windows-specific file paths. Their contribution is already merged into main, so if you install MTS for CLI on Windows today, you’ll get the improvement out of the box. No extra setup needed.

Thank you so much for your contribution, ATrueLight4! Your work brings us one step closer to MTS on Windows.


To show our deep gratitude for your contribution, we've granted you the exclusive ✨Top Contributor✨ badge on the Block Open Source Discord! You'll also be one of the first contributors to receive exclusive codename mts swag. (more info on that to be announced later 👀🪿)
